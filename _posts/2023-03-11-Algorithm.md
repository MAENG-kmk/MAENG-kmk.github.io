# 1. What is Algorithm

---

1. Algorithm is a description of *problem solving process*.
2. Algorithm is a training *how to think*.
3. Algorithm is an extension of the *Data Structure*.



# 2. Algorithm Design and Analysis

---

### *Good Algorithm*
* Be clear
* Be efficient

### 1. Recursion and Inductive thinking
* Recursive Structure
  * Inside a problem, there exists a subproblem similar with big problem.
  * ex) factorial, recurrence

### 2. Asymptotic Analysis
In small case, it's not necessary because it works fine in every small case. We need to think about bigger case, likes infinity. There are many asymptotic notation.

1. O-notation
2. Ω-notation
3. Θ-notation
4. o-notation
5. ω-notation

*O-notaion is usually used.*


# 3. Recurrence Analysis

---

There are three way to recurrence analysis.

### 1. Repeated replacement
### 2. Guess and prove
### 3. Master theorem
